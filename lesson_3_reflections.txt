When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Remote repository, would be ideal for collaborative project, when there are multiple people contributing 
  from different location on the same project.


 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 	1. Github, has commits from other people, and sometimes we need to work on progress and goal that we have set in local git repository and not be interfered by others.
 	2. So that we can pull and update only when it is required.
 	3. Other people might have deleted some lines which I wanted in the file Or added something which i didnt want, which will lead to conflict and will pop up randomly while I am busy working on something. This will cause frequent distraction from the current work to resolve the conflict.
